<h1>Batch Send</h1>


A very useful functionality to create and send voice messages with Callburn, is the __Batch Send__.

You can supply both recipients and voice messages all in one single file; moreover it is possible to send a different voice message for every recipient of the list.

__Batch send__ allows you to send multiple batch messages using a file, with this format:

                               phonenumber, text message 

Allowed formats are __.xls__, __.xlsx__, __.csv__, __.txt__ file. 

<note-box type="warning">
Phonenumbers should contain international prefix (with or without + sign) and supported delimiter are:   __.__   __,__    __:__    __|__    __tab__
</note-box>

In the first step of Batch Send, you must select the language, and your preferred voice, to convert all the texts inside the file in a set of audio files using _TTS technology_.  

After file uploading, you can review both recipients and texts, add functionalities and send your voice messages to recipients.

As well other voice messages, you can find your batch delivery in __Overview__ table and see all details of the delivery in __Overview Statistics__ table.
