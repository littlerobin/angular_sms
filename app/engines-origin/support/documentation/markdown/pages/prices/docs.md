<h1>Prices</h1>


One of the strong points of *Callburn Voice Messages* is **their prices**, really **CHEAP**! The other is our simple **Pricing**; only one plain, **you will pay only if your message will be listened**.  

Think that a standard SMS, costs at least **twice** of a Voice Message, and you pay for _all sent messages_, instead of __only for delivered__ ones.

You can consider a standard SMS, which is composed by 160 characters, like a **14'' audio voice message**.

<note-box type="info">
Callburn Voice Messages work with a **pre-paid credit**, and they are **normal phone calls** billed with a _minimum billable time of 20 seconds_ for every single message delivered.
</note-box>

To make you free from any preoccupation and further simplify your life, Callburn provides an __Autorecharge__ feature that, if enabled, it will recharge automatically your balance, whenever it goes lower than a minimum amount. 

After these first 20 seconds, only the **EFFECTIVE DELIVERED message seconds** will be billed.

<note-box type="note">
For "delivered message seconds" we mean the **effective call length**.  
</note-box>

For example, if your recipient receives your message of 3 minutes, but he listens 24 seconds and hangs up the call, you will be billed for **24 seconds only**.

There are no plans or strange bundles or tariffs to choose or understand; `we offer the best tariff to all the users`, cause **we don't make any difference between a small and a large customer**.		


	

<h2>Amount Calculator</h2>

You can always know exactly, how much you will spend with us, using our [**Amount calulator**](https://callburn.dev2/#/price); it allows you to know total cost and shows the different prices between countries.  

It's really simple, just put in __message destination__, __total message length__ and finally __successfully delivered quantity__.

<note-box type="tip">
An example? 
An *SMS* sent to *Italy* with a *Professional SMS Gateway* costs **0,07€** (**160 characters is like 14 seconds voice message**).		

A **Callburn Voice Message** until 20 seconds, also sent to Italy*, costs only **0,029€**.		

Just a little difference!!!

You can find it also in financials page of your account, so you can always know the effective cost for deliver your voice messages, before to recharge your Callburn balance.
