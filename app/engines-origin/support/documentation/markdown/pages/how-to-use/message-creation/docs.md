<h1>Compose Voice Message</h1>

As very first thing, you have got **three** methods for generating the voice content. 		

* <a href="#" ng-href="/api#/docs#option1">Write a text</a>
* <a href="#" ng-href="/api#/docs#option2">Upload an audio file</a>
* <a href="#" ng-href="/api#/docs#option3">Choose from Templates</a>

The first, and most flexible way, is __write__ a **text** that will be **converted** into a voice, the other one is __upload__ an existing audio file and the last one is to choose an audio file from the __Templates table__.

In the first two methods, before send the message, you can always listen your chosen voice message and also **save** it as a **Template**, to reuse it in another send. 

As you have seen in <a href="#" ui-sref="docs({dir:'how-it-works'})"> How it works</a> page, Callburn allows you to see all your saved Voice Messages in __Overview__ section. It is also possible to reuse a specific voice message in this table using the apposite __Reuse Message__ function.

<h2> Method 1: Write a text</h2> 

The easiest way to compose a Callburn **voice message** is just writing it. 

<note-box type="note">
Text will always be converted in voice before sending, using __TTS technology__.
</note-box>

You can easily choose preferred voice (from a big number of voices) in a wide selection of available country languages.  

This could be an obligated choice in some situations like:

* Impossibility to use the voice under certain circumstances 
* Physical handicap 
* Custom message for each sending
