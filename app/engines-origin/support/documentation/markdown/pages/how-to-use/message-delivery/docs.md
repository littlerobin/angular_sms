<h1>Message Delivery</h1>

We can say for sure that this last part, of **Compose New** section, is the most complete and powerful instrument that we could give you. Here you can revise and set a lot of features, to personalize your voice message.

In particular you can revise and set:

* <a href="#" ng-href="/api#/docs#option1">__Playback__</a>
* <a href="#" ng-href="/api#/docs#option2">__Human Voice answer detection__</a>
* <a href="#" ng-href="/api#/docs#option3">__Delivery repetition__</a>
* <a href="#" ng-href="/api#/docs#option4">__Sending from Caller ID__</a>
* <a href="#" ng-href="/api#/docs#option5">__Estimated sending time__</a>
* <a href="#" ng-href="/api#/docs#option6">__Maximum costs__</a>
* <a href="#" ng-href="/api#/docs#option7">__Email notification__</a>

From here, you can also configure __Message Interactions__, that Callburn provides to make your communication as more as complete and useful, like we will see in detail in <a href="#" ui-sref="docs({dir:'interactions'})"> __Interactions__</a> page.

Every single interaction performed by the recipient will be saved and easily recovered in __Statistics__ section of the __Overview__ panel. as we have seen in <a href="#" ui-sref="docs({dir:'how-it-works'})"> __How it works__</a> page.

To make you sure that all features are correctly set, Callburn allows you to send a __Preview Message on your mobile__.  This call will be billed as a normal Callburn Voice Message.

<note-box type="note">
When all the features are revised and confirmed, you can choose to **send immediately** or **schedule** your voice message
</note-box>

When you push on **"Send now"** button, Callburn tries immediately to reach your destination by **calling** it.   

>For a better understanding, we explain in detail what happens: 
  * Callburn calls your recipients once; if the destination answers, then the call will **be billed** to you and marked as **"Successful Call"**.  
  * If your destination doesn't answer, the system will retry to call it other **4 times every 5 minutes** until it answers.  
  * If your destination still doesn't answer, we will mark this call as **"Not Answered"** and the call will **not be billed** to you, as also __busy__ and __invalid__ recipients.

If you want give a scheduling to your delivery, Callburn provides a very complete panel explained in detail in the next  <a href="#" ui-sref="docs({dir:'schedule'})"> __Schedule__</a> page.

<note-box type="info">
It is also possible to __save__ all settings __as a draft__ and review all details in __Overview__ panel.
</note-box>
	

Now, let's have a look to all the above features that you can set in this step, one by one.
	

<a id="option1"></a>
<h2>Playback</h2>

You can set here, how many times the voice message should be played back; by default the __playback__ is only one time but we may set it until maximum of five times.
	

<a id="option2"></a>
<h2>Human Voice answer detection</h2>

This parameter may be _enabled_ or _disabled_.

If __enabled__, Callburn will wait for an __human voice__ answer before delivering your message and, if not detected, it will not deliver the message.

<note-box type="note">
If no Human voice is detected, Callburn will charge you only the first 5 seconds of the call instead of minimum billable (20 seconds).
</note-box>


This will be useful to assure delivery to a real human answer instead of answering machines, robots, or low network coverage providing call quality issues.


If __disabled__, all recipients may listen your voice message after they pick up the phone.

<note-box type="info">
The _positive_ impact is that there will not be delays in sound playback or failed human voice detections. The _negative_ impact is that answering machines will cut the message, or it will not be delivered at all.
</note-box>

By default this functionality is enabled.

Finally, if you enable Human voice detection, you can flag a box to allow to *retry delivery* of the voice message until a human voice answer is detected. The number of allowed retries is usually five.
	

<a id="option3"></a>
<h2>Delivery repetition</h2>

There are some situations where you must communicate with a group of recipients with a certain temporal frequency. 

Openings academic year , monthly business meetings, fiscal deadlines communication, are only a few examples.

![](/assets/imagedoc/Repetitions.png)

You can set, in the above panel, **how many times** you want to repeat your delivery, and **how often** (number of days between two repetitions).

<note-box type="info">
You can also set to repeat your delivery infinite times
</note-box>

You may always edit the next delivery from the __overview__ section and see also all completed deliveries from __overview statistics__ table, using the apposite _Batch_ filter.
	

<a id="option4"></a>
<h2>Sending from Caller ID</h2>

A great strength of Callburn is that all your recipients will be able to identify you always, because you can send the messages with your own Caller ID.

You can add a not limited number of valid Caller IDs, in settings section of your account, and in this step, you can choose which to use for sending your voice message.

<note-box type="note">
If you haven't any Caller ID validated, you cannot send any voice message.
</note-box>
	


<a id="option5"></a>
<h2>Estimated sending time</h2>

Based on number of recipients, Callburn will give you an estimated time to deliver your voice messages. 

If you don't change this parameter, Callburn will try to deliver at maximum speed using all its free channels. 

<note-box type="warning">
If some of your recipients will not be available to receive voice message (busy phone, out of network coverage or no answer) our system will retry delivery other 4 times with 5 minutes pauses between them. This may affect total delivery time.
</note-box>

If you want to split delivery through more time, then you could change speed of delivery chosen from 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes.

	

<a id="option6"></a>
<h2>Maximum costs</h2>

This parameter allows you to have always a complete view of how much you will be charged, for deliver your voice messages.

You can see all about the Callburn cost in <a href="#" ui-sref="docs({dir:'prices'})"> __Prices__</a> page.

Total cost of your delivery depends from a large amount of advanced settings. They are the *length* of voice message, total *number of recipients*, how many times must be *played back* the voice message, *interactions* if recipients will use them.

<note-box type="note">
Here we can give only an estimated price, because the final one will be affected from how many recipients will answer to the phone and if they will interact with your voice massage (number of playback, used interactions).
</note-box>

	

<a id="option7"></a>
<h2>Email Notifications</h2>

As the last thing, you can enable in this step email notifications, to stay always updated about all our news and special offers, and to be warned on all that concern with your Callburn activities.

You can enable email notifications also in __settings__ page of your account.
