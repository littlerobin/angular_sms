<h1>Call me Back</h1>

__Callback me back__ feature allows the recipient to book a callback to deepen the subject of the _voice message_, in a more convenient time. 

The recipient may request a callback pressing the corresponding callback phone digit.

You can find all the CallMeBack requests into __message statistics__ of the _Overview_ section.

When your recipient asks for a Call Me Back, a __second voice message__ will be reproduced to inform him about request acknowledgement. For this reason, you must put a second voice message.

You can choose this second voice message, by uploading an existing audio file or by choosing it from the saved templates voice messages. You can also compose this message also using the TTS technology. After composing you can listen the resulting audio file, before to choose it. 

<note-box type="warning">
Like with the others interactions seen, activate this feature may cause variations of final message length since a second message will be played to your recipient. This may affect your final cost (see more into <a href="#" ui-sref="docs({dir:'prices'})"> prices</a> page).
