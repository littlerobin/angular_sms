<h1>Blacklist me</h1>

The last advanced feature, to create an interactive communication, is the __Blacklist me__, that allows to identify who doesn't want to receive anymore calls from your Caller ID.

To better understand this feature, let's have a look to the next image:

When your recipient asks for a “Blacklist me” interaction, a __second voice message__ will be reproduced to inform him about request acknowledgement, and his phone number may be deleted or deactivated for messages reception. 

<note-box type="info">
You can find all the Blacklist me requests into __message statistics__ of the _Overview_ section, and here you can decide to delete these recipients from your Phonebook, if present. 
</note-box>

In some countries, “Blacklist me” feature, could be a legal requirement.

You can choose the _second voice message_ by uploading an existing audio file or by choosing it from the saved templates voice messages. You can also compose this message using the TTS technology. After composing you can listen the resulting audio file before to choose it.

Like with other interactions, activating this feature may cause variations of final message length since a second message will be played to your recipient. This may affect your final cost (see more into <a href="#" ui-sref="docs({dir:'prices'})"> prices</a> page).
