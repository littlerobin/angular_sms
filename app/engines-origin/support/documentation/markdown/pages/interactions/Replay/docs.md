<h1>Replay Voice Message</h1>

If the _voice message_ speaks about an address or telephone number or something else important, it is a good practice to use the __Replay Voice Message__ feature. 

It allows the recipient, by simply pressing a digit on his phone keypad, to play back the message and take note of it.

To activate Replay feature you must __choose a keypress__ to associate with.

<note-box type="note">
Be sure that your audio voice message (or text if TTS) is giving this keypress indication to your recipient, otherwise your recipient cannot know about this interaction. 
</note-box>

Activate this feature may cause variations of final message length, then may change final cost. See details in <a href="#" ui-sref="docs({dir:'prices'})"> prices</a>.

For example, if your total message length is 20’’ and anyone of your recipients, uses “Replay Voice Message”, your message will be replayed and total message length can become 40’’. 

<note-box type="warning">
For security reasons, this action can be repeated for a maximum of three times.
