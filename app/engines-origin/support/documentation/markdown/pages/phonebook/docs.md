<h1>Phonebook</h1>


Callburn provides an entire section to manage your favorite phone numbers that can be **saved**, **editing**, **deleting**, **grouping** and so on.

To create your __Phonebook__ you can easily batch add your contacts by uploading a file (csv, txt, xls, xlsx) or by pasting text or simply typing a phone number at time. 	

You can upload file from the web interface through basic file uploader or Drag&Drop interface.

If you need, it is possible to add extra informations into the file. You can use one of the following supported delimiters:	

								.	,	:	|	tab 

Supported format file is (separated by comma, for example):

                            phonenumber, group name, name 

 
<note-box type="warning">
The first value must be a phone number separated by a comma, semicolon or other delimiter from all other values that want to add. Other values are not mandatory. Don’t forget to put phone numbers with international prefix. 
</note-box>

As we have seen, to create voice messages, or to choose recipients, Callburn allows us to use both web application or mobile device platform; at same way, also in Phonebook, we may import phone numbers from the mobile phonebook, by using one of the available mobile applications.	

 After __Importing__ the contacts list, by pasting them or by uploading a file, you can can always revise the importation result, before saving it. 

You can check in this step, contacts correctly inserted and also errors, as shown in the next image.

The Phonebook section has got two subsections: one that contains all imported __contacts__ and the other one that shows all created __groups__. From either subsections it is possible to send a voice message by using the apposite action.

__Phonebook__ is a useful instrument, that gives you the possibility to organize all your phone numbers to send them _Voice Messages_, avoiding to import them every time you need.

Callburn allows also to __Export__ your entire phonebook or some groups in a *.csv* file, that can be opened in various spreadsheet applications - like Excel.
