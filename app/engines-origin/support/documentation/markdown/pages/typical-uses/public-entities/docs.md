The secretary can focus on other important works, while communications will be delivered with certainty to the families concerned. 

			


<h2>Civil Protection</h2>


The Civil Protection Department was created to ensure national security , trying to prevent and avoid human disasters in a country .
 
When born the need to communicate an impending weather event, for example, __timeliness__ is the watchword.
