<h1>Air Companies</h1>


Are you arrived in the airport and your flight was canceled? 
Have you tried to find the reason and discover that an sms or mail massage was sent to you, but you don't have seen it?


Keep calm! Callburn will not allow that this could happen another time! 


By using Callburn, the __air company__ knows well if a communication was received or not from you, since Callburn calls you on your mobile and it is able to be very, very insistent.  


<note-box type="note">
If the call doesn't receive any answer, Callburn will _retry_  other 4 times every 5 minutes until you don't answer the call. See more on <a href="#" ui-sref="docs({dir:'how-to-use/message-delivery'})"> Message Delivery</a> page
