<h1>Politics</h1>


There is a moment, in every democracy, when politicians ​try to ​persuade ​people to ​vote for them. We speak about __Election Campaign__.


During the period before the _Election Day_, all the political candidates use a lot of methods (legal or not) to manifest their intentions and make many promises to the people.


What better opportunity to use Callburn! It can be used _before_ , to do a poll on voting preferences, _during_ , to try to influence people's thinking, and _after_ , for thanks.


<note-box type="tip">
Using Callburn for the __polls__  saves time and money, allowing you to get wonderful results as only an __"automatic call system"__ can do.
