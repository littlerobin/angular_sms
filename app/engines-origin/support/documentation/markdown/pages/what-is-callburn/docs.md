<h1>What is Callburn</h1>

Callburn is a **Fast**, **Simple**, and **Flexible** alternative to [SMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Message_Service) "Short Message Service", providing **voice delivery** instead of a text.

We call them **"Voice Messages"** and they **ring** instead of *a single sms tone*, requesting an answer to discover their content as "*they arrive like a normal voice call and the content is inside that*".     


<h2>SMS disvantages</h2>
SMS are based on a very old technology, providing a lot of disadvantages, some examples:

* **Marketing SMS** are less effective because *customers prefer a warm voice* over a cold text of 160 characters.
* **Emergencies SMS** are not seen immediately, making them **useless** for **urgent** or **important** communications;	
* **Customer Care SMS** are really worst because doesn't support any kinda of live interactions from the user receiving it;
* **Fund Raising SMS** costs a lot and doesn't provide any blacklist for letting user unsubscribe from the list

With **Voice Messages** all these disadvantages are gone, you can look a nice comparison table in the <a href="#" ui-sref="docs({dir:'what-is-callburn/sms-comparison'})"> **next page** </a>          


<note-box type="tip">
Callburn Voice Messages **support interactions**, making you able to do a lot of things, like live call transfer, polls, ask questions, schedule a recall, inscribe to a list, and much more, with **infinities** possibilities 
You can found more information about interactions <a href="#" ui-sref="docs({dir:'interactions'})"> here</a>

<h2>Voice or Text as source?</h2>

You can provide both text and voice as source message content;		
 `Our systems will **always** deliver a voice message cause this is a *main feature* of **Callburn Voice Messages** 


<note-box type="note">
Callburn uses **TTS** technology to transform text into voice. In case of a **text input** as message content, we will convert it to voice before sending. The conversion is done in **less than 1 second** and it's automatic.

Although Callburn is a new technology, `it doesn't rely on mobile data` to deliver your voice messages and supports **every kinda of device** that can receive a normal phone call (like fixed phones or satellite).

<h2>Cheaper is better!</h2>

`We just work with prepaid credit`**, and you can recharge **exactly** the amount you want to.
`We don't make any difference` if you are a small customer or a giant company, **everyone will always have got the **same best price**.		

<note-box type="info">
The name **Callburn** is just a mix of the words **call** and **burn** . We have chosen this name because sometimes we need to communicate something in urgent way, and impossibility to do that can change our life. Minutes, seconds, inside an emergency there is no time to loose. This was the first scope of **Callburn Voice Messages**, providing an useful and better communication to the people.
